Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Open up the files

```{r}
library(readr)
# Specify the file path to your CSV file, change path as needed
games_file <- "games.csv"
games_details_file <- "games_details.csv" 

# Read the CSV file into a dataframe
games_data <- read_csv(show_col_types = FALSE, games_file)
games_details_data <- read_csv(show_col_types = FALSE, games_details_file)

# Print the first few rows of the dataframe to check the data
#head(games_data)
#head(games_details_data)
```

Find any duplicates and errors in the data

```{r}
# Load the required libraries
library(readr)

# Remove duplicates from the "GAME_ID" column
games_data_unique <- games_data[!duplicated(games_data$GAME_ID), ]
```

Left join to get the date column

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Convert the "GAME_ID" column to double data type in both DataFrames
games_data_unique <- games_data_unique %>%
  mutate(GAME_ID = as.double(GAME_ID))

games_details_data <- games_details_data %>%
  mutate(GAME_ID = as.double(GAME_ID))

# Merge dataframes using a left join based on GAME_ID
merged_data <- left_join(
  games_details_data,
  games_data[c("GAME_ID", "GAME_DATE_EST", "HOME_TEAM_ID", "VISITOR_TEAM_ID", "PTS_home", "PTS_away", "HOME_TEAM_WINS")],
  by = "GAME_ID"
)

# Identify the respective team's columns
merged_data$Team_Points <- ifelse(
  merged_data$TEAM_ID == merged_data$HOME_TEAM_ID,

  (merged_data$TEAM_ID == merged_data$HOME_TEAM_ID & merged_data$HOME_TEAM_WINS == 1) |
  (merged_data$TEAM_ID == merged_data$VISITOR_TEAM_ID & merged_data$HOME_TEAM_WINS == 0),
  TRUE,
  FALSE
)

# Rename the date column from games_data to avoid conflicts
colnames(merged_data)[colnames(merged_data) == "GAME_DATE_EST"] <- "gameDate"

# Drop unnecessary columns
merged_data <- merged_data[, !(names(merged_data) %in% c("HOME_TEAM_ID", "VISITOR_TEAM_ID", "PTS_home", "PTS_away", "HOME_TEAM_WINS", "NICKNAME", "START_POSITION", "COMMENT"))]

# Print the updated merged_data

Create new columns for the last game they played and how many minutes they played

```{r}
